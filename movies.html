<td>The book kept most of the same plot, but made a lot of unecessary changes and left things out. You would only notice if you had read the book, but it would
  have been much better if it had incorporated these small details into the movie. The movie was good, but the book was better.</td>

<td>The Hunger Games is one of my all time favorite books, and I thought the movie would destroy it. Surprisingly, they did a great
  job following almost everything that happened in the books. Other than some small details that only I (and maybe 2 other people) would
  notice, the movies were up to my extremely high standards.</td>

<td><img src="maze.book.jpg" width=300 height=200 alt="The Maze Runner book cover"></td>
 <td> This movie does not make sense at all. The sequels were even worse, and had almost nothing to do with the books. It was basically
   a new story with the same character names. If you loved the Maze Runner Series as much as I did, skip the movie.</td>
