<td>The book had the main storyline, but made a lot of unecessary changes. You would only notice if you had read the book, but it would
  have been much better had it incorporated these small details into the movie. The book was better.</td>

<td>The Hunger Games is one of my all time favorite books, and I thought the movie would destroy it for me. Surprisingly, they did a great
  job following almost everything that happened in the books. Other than some small details that only I (and maybe 2 other people) would
  notice, the movies were up to my almost impossible to reach standards.</td>

<td> The Maze Runner <br /> By: James Dashner </td>

 <td>That movie was awful and the book was so much better. The movie does not make sense at all, and after the first movie they went in a 
   competely different direction. It was basically a new story with the same character names. If you loved the Maze Runner Series as much as I 
  did, skip the movie.</td>
