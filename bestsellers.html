  <li class="number"><h4>The Selection<br />
      By: Kiera Cass</h4>
  <ul><li>I could not put this book down and pulled several all-nighters when reading this series. I was very reluctant to read the Selection,
    mostly because I had assumed by the cover that it wasn't a book I would like, but after several of my friends recommended it to me I read the entire
    series in days. Once I got past the fact that the main character's name was America it was actually a good book. I would definitley recommend the 
    series. However, there is a sequel series about her daughter that I could not even finish. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but 
    I found the new characters annoying and did not want to finish the book.

<li class="number"><h4>Paper Towns<br />
      By: John Green</h4>
  <ul><li>I did not hate this book, but it was not one of my favorites. Paper Towns was a little anti-clamatic, and the ending was disappointing. It took 
    too long
