 <h3>Best Selling Books</h3>
  <br />
<ol class="titled-list">
  <li class="number"><h4>The Selection<br />
      By: Kiera Cass</h4>
  <ul><li>I could not put this book down and pulled several all-nighters when reading this series. I was very reluctant to read the Selection,
    mostly because I had assumed by the cover that it wasn't a book I would like, but after several of my friends recommended it to me I read the entire
    series in days. Once I got past the fact that the main character's name was America, it was actually a good book. I would definitley recommend the 
    series. However, there is a sequel series about her daughter that I could not even finish. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but 
    I found the new characters annoying and did not want to finish the book.

<li class="number"><h4>Paper Towns<br />
      By: John Green</h4>
  <ul><li>I did not hate this book, but it was not one of my favorites. Paper Towns was a little anti-clamatic, and the ending was disappointing. I didn't really 
    care about what was happening until half way through the book, and by then I was bored and just reading it to finish. Paper Towns wasn't bad, but compared to some 
    of John Green's other books it was not very good.

<li class="number"><h4>The Trials of Apollo<br />
      By: Rick Riordian</h4>
  <ul><li>Percy Jackson is an amazing series that everyone my age has read at some point, and I was really excited for this book to come out. I had assumed
    that all of my favorite characters would be in it, and it would be another great series by Rick Riordian. Once I started reading, I realized that everything 
    would be about the new characters. I would have been okay with this, but I found the main character extremely annoying. I read about half of the book, but once
    the characters that I liked were no longer in the main plot, I quit. Maybe the series does get better, but I couldn't get past how annoying Apollo was.
